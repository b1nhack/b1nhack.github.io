[{"content":"I made a repository of Windows Shellcode runners: cpp-shellcode.\nHere are some introductions:\ncpp-shellcode is A repository of Windows Shellcode runners. The applications load and execute Shellcode using various API calls or techniques.\n❤️ THANKS @go-shellcode\nThe available Shellcode runners include:\nCreateFiber CreateRemoteThread CreateThread EtwpCreateEtwThread NtQueueApcThreadEx-Local CreateFiber This application leverages the Windows CreateFiber function from the Kernel32.dll to execute shellcode within this application\u0026rsquo;s process. This is usefull when you want to avoid remote process injection and want to avoid calling CreateThread.\nCreateRemoteThread This application leverages the Windows CreateRemoteThread function from Kernel32.dll to execute shellocde in a remote process. The application requires that the target process to inject into is already running. The program default injecting Explorer.exe\nCreateThread This application leverages the Windows CreateThread function from Kernel32.dll to execute shellcode within this application\u0026rsquo;s process. This is usefull when you want to avoid remote process injection.\nEtwpCreateEtwThread This application leverages the Windows EtwpCreateEtwThread function from ntdll.dll to execute shellcode within this application\u0026rsquo;s process. Original work by TheWover. This is usefull when you want to avoid remote process injection.\nNtQueueApcThreadEx-Local This application uses the undocumented NtQueueApcThreadEx to create a \u0026ldquo;Special User APC\u0026rdquo; in the current thread of the current process to execute shellcode. Because the shellcode is loaded and executed in the current process, it is \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo;. This same technique can be used for a remote process. NOTE: This will only work on Windows 7 or later. Reference APC Series: User APC API.\n","permalink":"https://b1n.io/posts/cpp-shellcode/","summary":"I made a repository of Windows Shellcode runners: cpp-shellcode.\nHere are some introductions:\ncpp-shellcode is A repository of Windows Shellcode runners.
